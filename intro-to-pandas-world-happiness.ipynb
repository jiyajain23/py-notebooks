    "# Exploratory Data Analysis - Intro to Pandas\n",
    "Welcome to the Pandas tutorial lab. This is the first notebook of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) series, where you will get your hands dirty applying the skills you have learned in the course on an actual data problem, similar to those you might encouter in real life! Here you will see and try out some basics of Pandas and get familiar with some of the useful functions that you will use across the other labs and assignments. If you already know Pandas well, feel free to skip this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the demonstration purposes you will use the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) dataset. The dataset consists of 2199 rows, where each row contains various hapiness-related metrics for a certain country in a given year. Right now you'll just use this dataset to understand some fundamental operations in Pandas. You will see this dataset again later in week 3, where you will dig deeper into the data and explore relationships to better understand which factors seem to best predict happiness.\n",

    "This notebook is not a comprehensive guide to Pandas, but rather shows and explains the functions you will use through this course. For a more comprehensive guide on Pandas, please see the [official tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) or check the documentation."

    "## 3.1 View the Dataframe\n",
    "You can use `DataFrame.head()` and `DataFrame.tail()` to view the first or last rows of the frame respectively. By default it will show you five rows, but you can specify the number of rows you want to see as a parameter. Technically, neither of the functions actually display anything, but just return a new dataframe. The dataframe is displayed because Jupyter notebooks show the output of the last row in the cell. You can also display the contents of your dataframe by simply writing `df`. If your dataframe is too long, it will then display only the first and the last few rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all of this only works if you use it in the last line of code in the cell, because the cells automatically display the output of the last line. If you want to see more than one dataframe by running a single cell or if you want to perform some other tasks after displaying the dataframe, then you better encapsulate it with `print()` or `display()`. `display()` function will print the dataframe, but with the same format as just calling `df`, whereas `print()` will print as plain text. \n",

    "You can see that even though in general higher GDP means higher value on the life ladder, this is not an universal truth. Comparing Slovenia (orange) with Brazil (green), you can see that people in Brazil earn less, but are on average happier than Slovenians through the years.\n",

    "Another very useful task you can do with plots is to visulize the distribution of your data. You will learn how to do this in more detail later, but for example you can easily plot a histogram using Pandas. Ise `DataFrame.hist()` on the dataframe you want to plot. Note that if you have many columns in the dataframe, this command will plot a histogram for each of the columns. You can select a single column from the dataframe if you only want to plot that one."

The second one, however, find the net difference between positive and negative affect. Perhaps there's an interesting set of patterns between this new column and other columns that you'd now be able to explore. What other columns might you want to calculate? In general, the ability to create new columns using operations on existing columns can be a powerful tool.\n",
