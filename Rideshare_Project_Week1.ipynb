    "# Exploratory Data Analysis - Understanding Your Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second notebook of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) series, where you will get your hands dirty applying the skills you have learned in the course on an actual data problem, similar to those you might encouter in real life! This is a part of a series, which contains five notebooks, each of them placed on different weeks of this course. There is very little mathematics instruction in these notebooks, but rather practical implementations of the concepts you learned using various python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook you will use the data on ridesharing in the year 2022 in the city of Chicago, which can be found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips/m6dm-c72p/data).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already downloaded the dataset for you and put it in the folder together with this notebook. If you check the link above, you might notice that the dataset includes hundreds of millions of rows. This translates to tens of gigabytes and is too large for working in this environment. That's why the dataset has been preprocessed to include only the data from 2022 and downsampled by a factor of 100 to easily fit into the environment and make your experience more pleasant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will mostly use the Pandas library. If you are not familiar with it, you can check out the Pandas tutorial notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "In this notebook you will use the following concepts from the course in a practical setting:\n",
    " - Probability\n",
    " - Conditional probability\n",
    " - Distributions\n"

    "\n",
    "- `Trip ID`: A unique identifier for the trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Trip Start Timestamp`: When the trip started, rounded to the nearest 15 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "- `Shared Trip Authorized`: Whether the customer agreed to a shared trip with another customer, regardless of whether the customer was actually matched for a shared trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Trips Pooled`: If customers were matched for a shared trip, how many trips, including this one, were pooled. All customer trips from the time the vehicle was empty until it was empty again contribute to this count, even if some customers were never present in the vehicle at the same time. Each trip making up the overall shared trip will have a separate record in this dataset, with the same value in this column.\n",

This is so that the histogram is scaled to look like a probability density function like the ones you saw on Lesson 2. This means scaling the plot so that the area of the bars equals 1. What does this distribution look like to you? Is it similar to any of the distributions you saw in the videos? \n",

Since this is real-world data, there are some fluctuations.\n",
